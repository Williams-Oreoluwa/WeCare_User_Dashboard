# My React App with Vite

This repository contains the source code for my React app built using the Vite framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow the steps below:

- **Prerequisites**: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

- **Installation**: 
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-app.git
     ```

  2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd my-react-app
     ```

  3. Install the project dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

- **Development**: 
  - To run the app in development mode, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the app in the browser.

- **Building for Production**: 
  - To build the app for production, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate an optimized production-ready build of your app in the `dist` directory.

- **Serve the Production Build**: 
  - To serve the production build locally, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run serve
    ```
    This will start a local server and serve the production build of your app.
